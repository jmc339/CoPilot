# CoPilot
CoPilot messaging service
Copilot is a Parking Services Add-on, that allows parking service members to send emails and sms messages to enrolled users. This would allow service members to update clients in real time when they receive a parking ticket, as well as warn them if they have their headlights on, or have their window down during a storm.
